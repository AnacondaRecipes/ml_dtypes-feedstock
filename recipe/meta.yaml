  summary: A stand-alone implementation of several NumPy dtype extensions used in machine learning libraries
  description: |
    ml_dtypes is a stand-alone implementation of several NumPy dtype extensions used in machine learning libraries, including:
    bfloat16: an alternative to the standard float16 format
    float8_*: several experimental 8-bit floating point representations including:
      float8_e4m3b11fnuz, float8_e4m3fn, float8_e4m3fnuz, float8_e5m2, float8_e5m2fnuz
    int4 and uint4: low precision integer types.
